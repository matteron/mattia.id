				<p>I [finally] added a write up of version 2.  I'd give you a link, but I never bothered to add anchors for the headers to my static site generator I guess!  If you search for 'Tono v2' on the page it should be the first result.</p>
				<p>I'm not a good writer in the first place and wrote it while very sick and sleep deprived, so I don't blame you if you just wanna look at the pretty pictures on the <a href="./tono-gallery.html">gallery page</a>.</p>

			<p>Tono is basically just a record player which takes cartridges instead of vinyl.  In the age of streaming services making it easy to quickly put music on without thinking, I wanted a device that could mimic the deliberate ritual that comes with a record player, without the associated price.  (I'm sure if I add up all the money I sunk into developing this thing, I probably aggressively missed that goal.)</p>
			<h3>Tono v1</h3>
			<img src="./img/tono/tono1.jpeg" alt="Tono v1">
			<p>Pictured above is the original Tono.  I started it conceptualizing it some time in December 2017, and finalized it late March of the following year.</p>
			<p>Compared to the current version, this was exceptionally quick development time.  I just got a raspberry pi 2B, a <a href="https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/boards/hifiberry-dac-pro/">HifiBerry DAC+ Pro</a> and got to work making it play music.</p>
			<p>At this point I had no idea what I was doing and the end product showed.  I ended up installing a whole media center os for the pi in order to get it to play music as I thought this was the <em>simplest</em> way.  At this point I have forgotten what the name of it was, but it's probably for the best.</p>
			<p>So anyway, music was done and I had to get the thing to read play cartridges.  Since I was trying to keep costs down, I decided to make the system be based on an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CSTW0IA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">RFID card reader</a>.  So the music itself was stored on the pi's sd card, and it would just match the card up to the corresponding album.</p>
			<p>The RFID cards themselves were pretty cheap in bulk.  I just needed a way to identify which card corresponded to which album, however I didn't just want to tape a picture of the album to the raw card, which started my [way too long] search for something that could hold both a [square] picture of the album and the card itself.  Finally I stumbled upon this market of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sunmns-Colorful-Picture-Fujifilm-Instant/dp/B07TDBQ6ZM/ref=pd_sbs_201_6/132-1168809-3464001?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07TDBQ6ZM&amp;pd_rd_r=21b41ea2-88f3-4d59-a5b3-d2dcc246cb77&amp;pd_rd_w=vgxPk&amp;pd_rd_wg=tBj0o&amp;pf_rd_p=7c0dad87-8a25-4c4f-9349-026039ea6cb3&amp;pf_rd_r=W4DTHGK88MQP8RT7Q60N&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=W4DTHGK88MQP8RT7Q60N">cheap plastic frames</a> for polaroids, and very luckily Fujifilm made a type of film that was perfectly square (most are rectangles).</p>
			<p>After a little trial and error, I got it to read the cards and start playing the correct album.</p>
			<p>After that, I needed some buttons for the previous/next track and play/pause buttons. I was and still am very into the mechanical keyboard community, so I ended up going with <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/switches/products/novelkeys-x-kailh-box-thick-clicks?variant=3747938238504">NovelKeys Jade Switches</a> as I wanted them to have a nice and crunchy click when interacting the device.  I bought some cheap blank keycaps to go with them and called it a day.</p>
			<p>The final step was to get some sort of case designed.  At the time I had absolutely no CAD experience, but I did have a friend studying mechanical engineering who just bought a 3D printer who was very excited to help me.</p>
			<p>We got the whole thing designed and printed, we then tried smoothing it out the print by giving an acetone bath, which arguable made it look way worse.</p>
			<p>Now all that was left was to get everything shoved inside.</p>
			<p>Again, very little experience.  I just sort of haphazardly wired everything together.  The thing I'm the most ashamed/proud of is that little rats nest of white wires.  It's the common ground.  I just stripped one of the wires and started soldering all the other grounding wires to it.</p>
			<p>But Tono v1 was complete!</p>
			<p>I was exceptionally proud of it, and also extremely critical.  Terrible wiring and design aside, it had some immediate problems.  The first and most noticeable was that it was <em>slow</em>, like <em>really slow</em>.  It would take a minute plus just to boot, and then after that would take forever to read and start playing the album.  Trying to remove a cartridge would sometimes not register and so wouldn't pause the music, and then sometimes inserting a new cartridge wouldn't change the album and just continue playing the current album, even if the RFID reader was correctly reading the album id.</p>
			<p>However these were all manageable problems, so I ignored them and carried on.  School was picking up again so I had to focus up and forget about it.</p>
			<h3>Tono v2</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<h4>Updated: January 3, 2024 (a casual 3.5 years later)</h4>
				<p>I do apologize if anyone read all those ramblings just to find a blank header where the description of the better version of the project was supposed to be.  The following is an even more rambley, unreviewed, and unedited attempt at remembering how I made v2.  You've been warned &lt;3</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>I'm a bit rusty on all the details now, but at some point I took another swing at the idea.  Main focus was performance and getting cartridge reading to be consistent.  Both issues kinda ruined the entire "experience" of using the thing so I got a little fixated.  My general goal was to not be worse than a record player.</p>
			<p>First thing was to get rid of the pi.  I mostly used it because it was easy and Tono was supposed to be a quick fun thing to try, but it was a whole computer running a proper os.  I still very much didn't know what I was doing, but was vaguely aiming at the world of single board computers because I felt like it something be powerful enough to play flac files (I still had a what.cd sticker on my water bottle in 2019, it better player flac files dang it).</p>
			<p>At some point I ran into the <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/">Teensy</a> since it had a 	on-board sd-card slot and a pre-made <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html">audio board</a>.  So I picked up the 3.5, immediately fried it by sending too much voltage to an input pin, then picked up a 4.1 because I guess I'd be more careful with it this time? Got the audio shield thingy working and there ya go, pretty serviceable little audio player.</p>
			<p>With the actually hard part of the engineering done by somebody else I was free to move on to the fun parts.  I think I originally spent some time bashing my head trying to get the RFID reader to be more consistent until taking a step back and trying to see if I could mimic what cartridge based game consoles were doing.</p>
			<p>I remember my a-ha moment was learning what a card-edge connector is.  Just stick a pcb with some exposed contacts against some pins and you have a circuit! Who knew?!</p>
			<p>I scoured digikey for a cool looking chunky connector and chose a really bad one, but I already bought it, digikey takes a while to ship, and I was doing this on a budget that should have gone to anything else, so it stayed.</p>
			<p>As I waited for my big fancy connector, I did some initial case designs (by myself this time, thank you very much) that I ended up mostly scrapping but kinda did give me an idea to work on.</p>
			<p>I wanted to have pcb's made because it seemed easy enough (just connecting wires really) and I never made one before.  So I pirated eagle, remembered I have a <code>.edu</code> email address, then cobbled together some initial pcbs for the connector and cartridge pcb's.</p>
			<p>The connector board was mostly to get the digikey connector stapled to the teensy + audio shield combo.  Had some pins to wire into a separate button pcb and two pins for power and ground.</p>
			<p>The cartridge board was going to be a binary encoded id.  Send a signal up one pin that is potentially connected to a bunch of other pins and see what's what.  For some reason I decided to add a 8-way dip switch to this initial version, like what was wrong with me, just use some solder bridges dummy, you cannot afford more digikey orders!</p>
			<p>Also at some point before even designing these pcb's I guess realized the Teensy took absolutely no time to turn on and start playing music. I could add two pins to the cartridge pcb, send voltage through that to the Teensy's power pins that I ripped up and you got a built in power switch.  I now understand why this was a bad idea, but I thought this was the coolest shit and had no idea that this was a bad idea.</p>
			<p>There was also the button board.  Back, Play, Next.  Four pins, not really special.  Ended up going with these non-keyboard micro switches mostly due to height and width of the switches + I liked the design of the key caps.  Definitely a worse tactile feel than Tono 1, but were serviceable.</p>
			<p>So I make my first ever Oshpark order, wait patiently, test vigorously, and quickly piece together all the mistakes I made designing these nothing-pcb's.</p>
			<p>Take two, cut down the footprint as much to cut down on price as much as I can.  Ditch the dip switches on the cartridge for...pins that I can cut with an exacto knife?  (I was getting closer at least).</p>
			<p>Button board was good (wow), so I go to order my second ever Oshpark order, take a shower, "oh fuck they can just be solder bridges", go to order my third ever Oshpark order.</p>
			<p>As I waited for my pcbs to arrive, I sketched up a version 2 of the case, then version 3 which was the final design, barring a few tweaks here and there.  Also, designed a case for the cartridge with a little slot to put album art. (Got some sketchy website to print out 3, likely, copyrighted album artwork stickers)</p>
			<p>Filled out my library's 3d printing lab google form and waited.  Biked over to pick up the prints, learned to make sure the two halves of the cartridge have a gap in the model or else the person working the lab will just print it as one piece.  One more form, one more bike ride, and it was done!</p>
			<p>I was proud of Tono 1, but it made me so happy to finish this project.  There's still a very cringe video of me on my twitter, gushing over a glorified teensy in a box that I will not be posting here.</p>
			<p>The problems of the first version were gone!  Basically turned on and started playing as soon as you inserted the cartridge! Reliably too! But this thing sucked in a new ways!  The case print was all warped because 3d printing was not as solved of a problem, sometimes it would not play sound for a couple seconds, randomly there'd be an incredibly loud buzz for about 2 seconds in the middle of tracks.</p>
			<p>But Tono 2 was done and then I never really used it because I got an office job and stress.</p>
			<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
			<p>A bigger apology for making you read all that!  I seem to be an even more annoying writer than I used to be!  </p>
			<p>This project was a ton of fun to make, but now mostly sits unused in a little box on my bookshelf</p>
			<p>I've had occasional thoughts on a version 3.  More refined case design, have a snes-style bay-door for the slot, make the cartridge an sd-extender (though that goes against keeping the carts cheap and easy), correct way to do the cart-power-switch idea, etc.  But, I haven't really ended up using Tono for listening so I haven't carved out the time yet.  Oh well!</p>

			<p>A few months after I wrapped up v2, I remember I had a <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/megaman/images/0/08/MMNTWG4141.png/revision/latest?cb=20140320003212">Megaman Battle Network toy</a> that used cartridges.  Took one apart and found the same idea I used for Tono 2.</p>
			<p>I do still have a zip in my backups of all the progress pics, model files, etc that I still have.  <a href="./tono-gallery.html">Here's a quick gallery page</a> I whipped up.</p>
			<p>Thanks to <a href="https://merveilles.town/@tendigits/111637465838546333">tendigit's</a> post for reminding me to finally do some sort of write up for Tono 2.</p>
			<p>Best of luck to everyone in 2024!</p>
